\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item
  Why I came to work on reproducibility issues
\item
  Agreeing on the scale of the problem and why the situation is blocked

\item

\section{Part I: Introduction}\label{part-i-introduction}

\begin{frame}{Why I came to work on reproducibility}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Engineering applied mathematics to biology background.
\item
  Method development for brain imaging, managed research projects, large
  imaging genetics databasing. \emph{Constant interactions with
  cognitive neuroscience and clinical research.}
\item
  Realized brain imaging research done was poorly reproducible,
  inefficient, and mistakes were ubiquitous.
\item
  Many of us were playing the ``publication and grant'' game.
\item
  Invested some times in neuroinformatics and took a job at Berkeley
  where reproducibility was considered an important axis
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The scale of the problem in Brain Imaging and what is the
current culture}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  NIH is investing \textasciitilde{}400M\$ each year in neuroimaging
  studies.
\item
  ``Would the finding for which this paper is published be replicated on
  another dataset?''
\item
  Difficult to assess, only a few relevant papers, tend to show little
  replication.
\item
  20 years of experience with researchers using neuroimaging as a tool:

  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    PhDs / Postdoc / tenured researchers need papers and grants
  \item
    ``Data squeezing'', p-hacking, double dipping
  \item
    Percentage of solid and replicable studies in brain mapping :
    {[}5\%-25\%{]}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Percentage of re-usable data \& analyses? Less than a few percents if
  not funded specifically for sharing.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why is the non reproducibility culture very difficult to
change?}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Researchers need/want jobs, they optimize their behaviour to get jobs
\item
  Universities need money and they will optimize criteria to get grants
\item
  Administrations love quantitative criteria
\item
  Conclusion: publication-centered culture, the widely accepted
  ``currency''

  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    research has become a competitive game: be the quickest, beat
    competition
  \item
    keep ``your'' data for yourself, or trade it for authorship
  \item
    a culture of secrecy and sloppiness: no time to check things or
    train yourself properly
  \end{itemize}
\item
  A great deal of cynicism / disillusion in many senior researchers
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\section{Part II: Who can do what?}\label{part-ii-who-can-do-what}

\begin{frame}{Incentives and Punish by reward}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item
  Most of us think we need to change the incentives: the ``rewards'', or
  ``punish'' bad behaviour
\item
  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./img/punish_by_reward_d1200s50.jpg}
  \caption{Punish by reward}
  \end{figure}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Do not change the incentives}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Because these new incentives will be optimized and abused.
\item
  Because working for specific incentives is likely to be detrimental to
  the work
\item
  Because evaluation cannot be reduced to a set of numbers: it takes
  time and competences.
\item
  Carrots and sticks seem to work very well for some pets, but do they
  for researchers?
\item
  Conclusion: Remove incentives as far as possible
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Mostly the funding agencies' call}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Other ``stakeholders'' are stuck in local minima, or need to feed
  their kids
\item
  Funding agencies have the less constraints
\item
  Consider all ethical aspects in clinical research: strong rational for
  sharing
\item
  Consider how much is re-used of what has been funded: make research
  less costly / more efficient
\item
  Consider funding infrastructures for sharing data, or for training
\item
  Consider continuous funding of current infrastructures (how ?)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Practical steps:}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Grant review guidelines have a new section: significance, feasibility,
  \ldots{} \emph{replicability+re-usability},
\item
  Evaluation of the applicants will include ways previous research can
  be re-used
\item
  Code and data are released with appropriate license and reviewed as
  deliverable (data paper?)
\item
  Increase funding in development of tools for open-science
  (data-sharing, collaborative tools)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Universities' call: Train on statistical and computational
methods}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Train on open and collaborative science (eg git/github)
\item
  Train life science researchers in depth programming skills (``data
  science'')
\item
  Train life science researchers in depth in statistics (``data
  science'')
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Researcher's call: The research manifesto / ``Hippocratic
oath''}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  I will make my research open and let tools and data be re-usable by
  others
\item
  I will foster collaboration in the areas where this would improve the
  work
\item
  I will take the time to train myself in key areas
\item
  I will consider how my actions are first benefiting the progress of
  knowledge
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{On the statistical / computational side of things}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  The damaging effect of p-values (cf psychology journal ban on
  p-values)
\item
  Effect sizes and power: journals' call
\item
  Publish models and model comparisons
\item
  Replication with open data
\item
  Code review and testing (``un-tested code is broken code'')
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\section{Part III: Conclusion}\label{part-iii-conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion: What shall we do about it}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Train the new generation of scientist in computation, statistics, open
  science
\item
  Multiply initiatives like OSF, many lab and community based projects,
  METRICS (Meta-Research) institutes
\item
  Work with journals and editors to accept well powered null findings,
  replication studies
\item
  Foster a culture of re-usable science through new grants/publications
  calls and guidelines
\item
  Foster the ``replicate and advance'' culture.
\end{itemize}
